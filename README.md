# Cave Escape Project

## Whiteboarding Images

These are concepts I drew on whiteboards when initially planning out the game. They detail the generic layout and features I had planned. 

### Map Initial Concept
First draft of the map of my game. I used this to see how many rooms I could expect to have if I had the time to make the game semi-complicated. Included potential concepts to trick the player, including circular layouts and dead ends.

### Map Fixed
The original photo had a typo in it (two Room #11s) so I cleaned it up. Decided to go with this layout for now since it makes sense, even though it might be a bit complicated to write out.

### Landing Page 1.0
Quick first draft of what I wanted the landing page to look like. Not very detailed.

### Landing Page 2.0
Much more detailed landing page. Used as a framework for when I wrote the HTML and CSS for the page.

### MVP Features
First draft of the features I wanted for the minimally viable product. Mostly focused on thinking about the logic behind how the game would work.

### Extra Features
Some of the features I wanted to develop if time allowed. Some of them are unrealistic for my current ability with JavaScript

## Checklist
Initial checklist for creating the game. Didn't have the time to list more than the MVP features.

### Priority Matrix
Priority matrix for the game. Took the points from the checklist and organized them based on what I thought would take longer and what was a priority. See the checklist for details. Also doesn't include extra features.
